Also you can clone this repo and run`yarn install` and then `yarn start`

# Features I built

- Every "turn" is 2 seconds, cars move each turn if there is space and the light lets them move
- Each lane has room for 5 cars before the stoplight and 5 cars after the stoplight
- Cars are randomly generated at the back of the lanes if they are open. The color is random, but the color should help you follow 1 car's trip
- Stoplights are on a timer, with left turns going first and then the straights for that route
- Cars in the right turn lane turn into the right lane, cars in left turn lanes turn into the left lan

# Next features up if I had time

- Make the lights have sensors to determine next state instead of just time
- Allow for more cars in each lane
- Allow for cars that are 2x length, and how those would change how everything else moves
- Allow for custom input on car randomness frequency, timer lengths
- Make the UI more clear what is happening
- Add more car picture options

# Time spent

I spent approximately 4.5 hours building and deploying this.
